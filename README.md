# 🧪 Machine Learning Evaluation & Utility Suite (Python)

Welcome to the Evaluation & Utilities section of this ML repository!  
This collection features **from-scratch implementations** of key evaluation metrics, statistical tools, and data processing utilities used across supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks.

## ✨ Features

✅ **End-to-End Evaluation** – Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and more  
📊 **Confusion Matrix Visuals** – For both binary & multiclass classification  
🔁 **Cross-Validation** – Manual K-Fold splitting and validation  
📉 **Error Visualization** – Compare model predictions graphically  
📐 **Statistical Tools** – Covariance matrices, Gaussian distributions  
🔀 **Data Splitting** – Train/test split without external libraries
